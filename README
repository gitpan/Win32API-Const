Win32API::Const -- Win32 API Constants

LOCATION
--------
http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/Win32API/


SYNOPSIS
--------

Win32API::Const -- contains all of the Win32 constants, such as
WM_CLOSE, SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED, etc


SETUP
-----

You must have a compiler such as Borland or VC to compile and install
Win32API::Const. If you are using VC, during the installation it asked if you
wanted to register environment variables (default was off/unchecked). If you
did not turn this on, you must run vcvars32.bat to set up these variables.

In the following steps, $MAKE represents the name of your make utility. This
is "nmake" for VC. Borland users should download Gurusamy Sarathy's port of
dmake from http://www-personal.umich.edu/~gsar/.

1)  If you're using ActivePerl, you first need to fix one of its bugs. See below.

2)  Expand the .gz file (using, for example, WinZip) and its folders. Switch to
    the directory you expanded it into.

3)  perl Makefile.PL

4)  $MAKE

5)  $MAKE test
    (this step uses the English version of Notepad to test the modules. You can skip
	the test if you're installing on a foreign language OS, or overwrite notepad.exe
	with an English version).

6)  $MAKE install

Ta da! Them's the basic steps for installing any perl module.

To reinstall, run "$MAKE realclean", then skip back up to step #3.


ACTIVEPERL
----------

The Perl installation program (MakeMaker) uses Config.pm (located in one of
your Perl subdirs) to install Perl modules. Unfortunately, when ActivePerl is
installed, it does not set up Config.pm correctly.

To fix it:

1)   Find Config.pm. If you installed ActivePerl into C:\Perl (the default) it
     will be in "C:\Perl\5.00502\lib\MSWin32-x86-object\Config.pm".

2)   attrib -r Config.pm

3)   Open Config.pm in notepad.

4)   Change the "libpth=" line to include your lib dir for VC as well as the
     directory where ActivePerl installed perlcrt.lib to (by default,
	 "C:\Perl\5.00502\bin\MSWin32-x86-object")

	 For example, my "libpth=" line looks like this:

     libpth='C:\Perl\5.00502\bin\MSWin32-x86-object "C:\Program Files\dev\vs\VC98\Lib"'

	 Your libpth will *definitely* look different since I didn't install VC into
	 the default directory.

5)   The last item in the "libs=" line is perlcrt.lib, without a path. Put the
     full path on perlcrt.lib.

	 For example, my "libs=" line looks like this:

	 libs=' oldnames.lib kernel32.lib user32.lib gdi32.lib  winspool.lib comdlg32.lib advapi32.lib shell32.lib ole32.lib  oleaut32.lib netapi32.lib uuid.lib wsock32.lib mpr.lib winmm.lib  version.lib odbc32.lib odbccp32.lib C:\Perl\5.00502\bin\MSWin32-x86-object\perlcrt.lib'

Whew! That should work.


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

All the documentation is stored in the .pm files, in POD format. To view the documentation:

1)  Switch to the directory containing a .pm file, such as Const.pm.

2)  Run "pod2html Foo.pm > Foo.html" where Foo is the name of the module.

3)  View Foo.html in your web browser.
